# Dynamic Product Gallery

This is a dynamic product gallery application built with React that allows users to view, filter, sort, and search products. The gallery fetches product data from a JSON file or mock API and displays it in a modern, responsive layout. Users can filter products by category and price range, sort them by price or popularity, and view additional details in a modal.
